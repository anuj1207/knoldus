The data on remote is now cloned to Anuj and Jatin. It is a file named 'Assignment1.txt' 

Currently the data in the file is:

data1 by anuj
data1 by jatin
data2 by anuj

now jatin modifies the data and adds two more lines to the file Assignment.txt
and the data is pushed to the remote git

Now the data on the remote is:

data1 by anuj
data1 by jatin
data2 by anuj
data2 modified by jatin
data3 modified by jatin

Now consider the local git of anuj. It has the old data i.e. only 3 lines of files

Data on the local anuj :

data1 by anuj
data1 by jatin
data2 by anuj


Now anuj adds one more line to the file and commits the data

Data on the local anuj :

data1 by anuj
data1 by jatin
data2 by anuj
data3 by anuj

Anuj tries to push the data to the remote git:
Failed(Hint: Remote contains some changes that local does not contain)

Now anuj needs to pull the data from server to add those new lines to his file.

Here remote and local git of anuj goes into two different directions.
Hence Anuj need to do the three way merge to push his data and get new data from remote
Three way merge merges the different data and the sequence becomes linear.

Three way merge is done by rebasing to eliminate the extra commit. 
Rebase doesnt give the extra commit in the log hence the path is now linear.
Rebase arranges the path that puts new data from remote before new data from local git


Now the steps are: 

$ git pull --rebase
pulls the data and does three way merge

now the file contains two check points in the file:
1.<<<<<< HEAD(shows changes in remote)
2.>>>>>>(commit message of loca)(shows changes in local)
